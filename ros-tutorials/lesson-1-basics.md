# Lesson 1 - Basics

## Summary
This lesson will introduce you into the very basics of ROS. By the end, you will know how to start ROS and run the turtle simulation. Before starting, you should take a few minutes and just read/watch videos about ROS in general, so you have a general understanding on what it is used for.

## Vocab
- ROS: Robot Operating System, the software we are learning about
- `roscore`: Command used to start ROS
- turtlesim: A ROS package that displays a turtle and allows basic interactions

## Goals
1. Start the roscore
2. Display the Turtle
