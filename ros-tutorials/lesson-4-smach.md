# Lesson 4 - SMACH

## Summary
The Task Planning portion of our codebase uses a package called SMACH to organize and coordinate our tasks. SMACH allows us to create state machines and represent different actions as states.

In this lesson, you will use SMACH to control a turtle.

## Vocab
- **State Machine**: A concept consisting of states and transitions connecting those states. Depending on the outcome of each state, a different transition will taken, switching the state machine to the next state.

## Goals
1. Use SMACH to have the turtle move in some direction. Then, based on a random choice, the turtle should turn either left or right and move in that direction.
    - Your state machine should contain at least 3 different states.

## Notes
- This lesson will be easiest if you adapt the code from the previous lession, rather than starting from scratch. It is recommended that you make a copy of your move_square.py file and work in that.
