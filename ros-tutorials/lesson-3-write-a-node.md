# Lesson 3 - Write a Node

## Summary
In this lesson you will write your own node to control the turtle. This will involve making your own package,
and writing a node inside that package.

## Vocab
- Package: A folder of nodes, messages, all related to some common goal or concept

## Goals
1. Create your own package
   - Do not use `catkin_make`, use `catkin build`. See resources and notes for more details

## Resources
- https://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
- http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/CreatingPackage

## Notes
- In the second tutorial, on the official ROS site, use it more as an explanation of packages. When
creating your own, use the catkin_tools documentation. This means you should not be using commands
like `catkin_create_pkg` and `catkin_make`.
- In the catkin_tools documentation, look at Quickstart for how to initialize a new workspace
