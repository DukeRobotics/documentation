# Part 1 - Electrical Assembly

## Goal

To design and assemble all electronics necessary to be able to control the robot's movement.

## Components

* **Chassis:** The body of the vehicle.
* **Motors:** Spin the wheels.
* **Raspberry Pi:** A miniature computer.
  * Requires a constant voltage to be supplied.
* **Battery Pack:** Holds the batteries.
* **Switch:** Controls flow of electricity.
* **Motor Controller:** Provides power for the motors.
* **Voltage Regulator:** Takes in a varying input voltage and supplies a constant output voltage.

## Tools

* **Wire Strippers:** Used to remove the rubber casing of wires.
* **Wire Cutters:** Used to cut wires.
* **Soldering Iron:** Used to make connections between wires and other electrical components.
* **Power Supply:** Can provide voltage at either a constant voltage or current.
* **Multimeter:** A versatile tool that can measure voltage, current, connectivity, and has many other functions

## Skills

* **Soldering:** A method of connecting two wires by heating up an area and feeding solder into the joint.
* **Voltage Regulator Calibration:** The way to calibrate the output of a voltage regulator.

## Instructions

Note: This page is rather minimal, you will likely need to look up components to learn more about them.

1. Figure out how the components should be wired together to produce a working system.
2. Draw a wiring diagram.
