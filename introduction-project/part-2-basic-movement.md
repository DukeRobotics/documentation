# Part 2 - Basic Movement

## Goal

To program the robot to move:

1. Forwards and backwards
2. In a square

## Summary

Now that we have a robot, we can start to program it. This will involve writing a python script \(or scripts\) to control the robot. This tutorial will provide you with a series of tasks to lead up to this.

## Tasks

1. Flash your SD card
   * Use the most recent image here: [https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html](https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html)
2. Find a resource that explains how to use GPIO pins on the raspberry pi in python.
3. Make an LED blink 2 times a second.
   * Use a 220 Ohm resistor
4. Read about Pulse Width Modulation.
5. Figure out how to do PWM on the raspberry pi.
6. Make the motor turn.
7. Make the robot move forwards.
8. Make the robot move in a square.

### Notes

Pins for test sd card:

Direction pin pairs: \(22, 23\), \(6, 12\)

PWM pins: 13, 18
