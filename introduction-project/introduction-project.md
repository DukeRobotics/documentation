# Introduction Project

## Summary

Welcome to the introductory project for the Duke Robotics Club! This is an interdisciplinary project that will require collaboration between members in all teams. The idea is to build, from scratch, a mini bot capable of moving around, as well as reacting to the environment using a camera. It will involve mechanical work to design and manufacture a chassis, electrical work to put together all of the components, as well as CS work to actually program the bot.

### Steps

Part 1: Assemble the base chassis. This will eventually be replaced by better chassis designed by the mechanical team.

Part 2: Assemble electronics. This will involve wiring together all the electronics.

Part 3: Basic Movement. Start controlling the motors and wheel to move the robot.

Part 4: Learn some basic computer vision to track a ball.

Part 5: Integrate parts 3 and 4 to get the robot to always point towards the ball.

Part 6: Program the robot to stay a constant distance from the ball \(while facing it\).

### Disclaimer

This is the first time we are trying this project, so there will be technical difficulties! We will do our best to work with you on these problems, and when we do solve them please put an entry in the Q & A page. This will allow other people to benefit from your newfound knowledge, and debug the problem themselves.
