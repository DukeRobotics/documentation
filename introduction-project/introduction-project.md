# Introduction Project

## Summary

Welcome to the introductory project for the Duke Robotics Club! This is an interdisciplinary project that will require collaboration between members in all teams. The idea is to build, from scratch, a mini bot capable of moving around, as well as reacting to the environment using a camera. It will involve mechanical work to design and manufacture a chassis, electrical work to put together all of the components, as well as CS work to actually program the bot.

### Disclaimer

This is the first time we are trying this project, so there will be technical difficulties! We will do our best to work with you on these problems, and when we do solve them please put an entry in the Q & A page. This will allow other people to benefit from your newfound knowledge, and debug the problem themselves.
