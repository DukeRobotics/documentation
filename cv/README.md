# Computer Vision

The general process for image detection via machine learning is as follows:

1. Divide the frames from the source video.
2. Unzip the folder containing the images.
3. Use labelImg on each of these creating bounding boxes for any desired objects.
4. Using the labelled images from before, train a model to detect the images.
5. Upload the model to docker for later use.

Look in the folders for information on how to do these tasks in more detail.
